## About me ðŸ“”

**Software developer** for over four years and for two years I have been studying the *financial market*, mainly **cryptocurrency**, focusing on building systems for *Fintechs* and working with *payment systems*, both proprietary and integrating with existing systems, accounting calculations and graphs of financial data in realtime, *Big Data* and process automation for *Forex* and *Traders*.

## Rust <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Rust_programming_language_black_logo.svg/1024px-Rust_programming_language_black_logo.svg.png" width="32px" />

Rust's three main concepts like performance, reliability and productivity make language my favorite. The convenience of building modules for Javascript with WebAssembly makes it possible to go beyond, when it comes to development. With Rust I can put into practice all the concepts necessary for the construction of Blockchains, Smart Contracts and Cryptography. The development of systems for user authentication, embedded as in the case of fingerprint reading or token reader is the best choice.

## Python <img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/python-12-555278.png" width="32px" />

Python's simplicity and robustness make this language an essential part of my work. Tools such as Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook and Spyder IDE assist in the creation of powerful Blockchain and Big Data services. With a wide variety of data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy and many others that make the development of payment systems and software for the financial market very efficient and complete.

## Javascript <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/452/javascript.png" width="32px" />

It was my first language and the one I have a certain affection for. A simple and extremely complete language that is present at different levels of development, whether in the frontend, backend or mobile. Tools like Node and Deno, along with the powerful Typescript, provide rapid development of APIs and applications. For the creation of rich applications and rapid prototyping of mobile applications, without a doubt my choice is Javascript.
