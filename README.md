## About me

**Software developer** for over four years and for two years I have been studying the *financial market*, mainly **cryptocurrency**, focusing on building systems for *Fintechs* and working with *payment systems*, both proprietary and integrating with existing systems, accounting calculations and graphs of financial data in realtime, *Big Data* and process automation for *Forex* and *Traders*. Enthusiastic about **blockchain**, cryptocurrencies and passionate about the *open-source* universe. Evangelist of **dApps**, decentralized applications. *Linux* Fanboy.

## Rust

Rust's three main concepts like performance, reliability and productivity make language my favorite. The convenience of building modules for Javascript with WebAssembly makes it possible to go beyond, when it comes to development. With Rust I can put into practice all the concepts necessary for the construction of Blockchains, Smart Contracts and Cryptography. The development of systems for user authentication, embedded as in the case of fingerprint reading or token reader is the best choice.

## Python

Python's simplicity and robustness make this language an essential part of my work. Tools such as Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook and Spyder IDE assist in the creation of powerful Blockchain and Big Data services. With a wide variety of data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy and many others that make the development of payment systems and software for the financial market very efficient and complete.

## Javascript

It was my first language and the one I have a certain affection for. A simple and extremely complete language that is present at different levels of development, whether in the frontend, backend or mobile. Tools like Node and Deno, along with the powerful Typescript, provide rapid development of APIs and applications. For the creation of rich applications and rapid prototyping of mobile applications, without a doubt my choice is Javascript.

## Payments

Experience in the development of payment systems and integration with existing payment systems. I work with payment system integrations from financial institutions such as banks to fintechs or payment services that require subscription. I actively participate in the open source community for monetization on the web. I would say that this is my specialty.

## Blockchain

## Cryptocurrency

With the arrival of the future that cryptocurrencies bring, I have experience with the development of payment systems using digital currencies. One of my most recent studies is about ways to invest in the digital world and in DeFi. With a large market on the rise, large companies are increasingly adopting payment systems through currencies and digital assets, as a Blockchain and digital currencies enthusiast, I believe that the hundred percent digital future is near.
